The resolution of psykhexx team in NTIRE 2025 [Night Photography Rendering Challenge](https://nightimaging.org/)
==============================

  This repository contains the source code of solution from the psykhexx team in NTIRE 2025 Night Photography Rendering Challenge
Our pipeline consists of five main steps, each of which optimizes a different aspect of
the image. First, we performed a series of corrections and pre-processing on the original input image to
obtain a cropped sRGB image. Then, we use two independent neural networks, IAT[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14871) and SCUNet[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13278),
to render the image with an end-to-end feature fusion strategy, borrowing from the image processing
methods of professional photographers. Specifically, IAT is responsible for adjusting contrast, brightness,
hue, and saturation to enhance the dynamic range and color performance of the image; while SCUNet
combines noise reduction and edge enhancement to further optimize image quality and visual perception.

### The purpose of participating in the competition is purely for scientific research training.

We won the fifth place in the fourth phase of the NTIRE 2025 Night Photography Rendering Challenge.

And we got the 4th place in the final test.

We also wrote a [document](document.pdf) summarizing and describing our work, with many quotations from the paper IAT[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14871) and SCUNet[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13278).
